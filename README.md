# term-quizz

A simple tool attempting to make presentations a little
more interactive.

Largely inspired by [sshtron](https://github.com/zachlatta/sshtron)

## Launch

Create a key first:

```
# Create an RSA public/private keypair in the current directory for the server
# to use. Don't give it a passphrase.
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -f id_rsa
```
